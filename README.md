# Check for a linked Azure DevOps work item

Use this action to check your pull request to make sure it is linked to a work item using ``AB#`` before you can merge.

[Click here](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/azure-boards-check-for-ab) to see the action in the GitHub marketplace.

## üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Usage

Make sure the GitHub repository is properly linked to an Azure DevOps project. The following docs will help you get started and setup:

- [Learn about the Azure Boards - GitHub integration](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/?view=azure-devops)
- [Install the Azure Boards app](https://github.com/marketplace/azure-boards)
- [Connect a GitHub repository to Azure Boards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/add-remove-repositories?view=azure-devops)
- [Link GitHub commits and pull requests to work items in Azure Boards](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/boards/github/link-to-from-github?view=azure-devops)

## üë©‚Äçüè´ How it works

The action will check the pull request description for ``AB#`` and a valid work item id. If it finds a valid work item id, it will pass. If it does not find a valid work item id, it will fail.

If the sender is ``dependabot[bot]`` the action will ignore the check.

## üîë Permissions

You might get an error whent the action is run. If you open the error log and see something like this:

``
"Error: Resource not accessible by integration" 
``

To fix this, go to ``https://github.com/{owner}/{repo}/settings/actions`` and in **Workflow Permissions** section give actions **Read and Write permissions**. That provides the token with rights to modify your repo and solves your problem.

## ‚úÖ Codes

We use a series of code values to mark and check previous comments to ensure the actions does not get too chatty after each run. For example, if you don't add ``AB#{ID}`` to the description, we don't need to tell you every time you update the desciption. We will only tell you once untill something changes.

### lcc-200

Successfully found a valid work item id in the pull request description.

### lcc-404

Missing ``AB#`` in the pull request description.

### lcc-416

Found ``AB#`` but the work item id is not valid.

## üìÑ validate-pr-ab.yml

This is the main workflow file. It will run on any pull request that is opened, reopened, or edited. It will only run on the ``main`` branch. This file needs to be added to the ``.github/workflows`` folder in your repository.

```yml
name: 'Description contains AB# with a valid work item id'
on: # rebuild any PRs for main branch changes
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, reopened, edited]
    branches:
      - main
